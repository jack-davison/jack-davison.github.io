### Who am I?

- I am an Atmospheric Chemistry PhD Student in the [Wolfson Atmospheric Chemistry Laboratories](https://www.york.ac.uk/chemistry/research/wacl/) at the University of York, UK. My main research interests lie in the remote measurements and modelling of road transport exhaust emissions.

- I've been using and refining my R skills over the past three years, with particular attention to the [Tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) suite of R packages.

- I have contributed to the [#TidyTuesday Project](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/README.md) since Summer 2020. My submissions can be found on my [GitHub](https://github.com/jack-davison) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/JDavison_).
