    "text": "My PhD thesis (Davison 2022) focused on the calculation of representative emission factors from vehicle emission remote sensing data. An emission factor is a value used to estimate a total emission from a sector (e.g., transport) from a more measurable activity (e.g., total kilometres driven).\n\\(Emission~Estimate~\\left(g\\right) = \\textbf{Emission~Factor}~\\left(g~km^{-1}\\right) \\times Measured~Activity~\\left(km\\right)\\)\nTypically these emission factors are based on data from a very limited range of vehicles, most commonly from lab tests but also from instrumented vehicles (Portable Emissions Monitoring Systems, PEMS). While these give good journey coverage, capturing everything from idling to bombing down the motorway, they give poor fleet coverage, only measuring a handful of “representative” vehicles.\nVehicle emission remote sensing is a technique for measuring a lot of vehicles. Think of it as a bit like a speed camera with a spectrometer attached, that being an instrument capable of measuring pollutant concentrations in the atmosphere. While the use of remote sensing rapidly populates a database of hundreds of thousands of tailpipe concentration measurements, only measuring a dispersing plume (rather than the sum total of all tailpipe emissions) means some robust statistical modelling is required to calculate representative emission factors.\nOne of the key outcomes from my research was the clear significance of the difference in emissions between vehicle manufacturers. Figure 1, taken from Davison et al. (2021), illustrates the distribution of different distance-specific emissions for different vehicle manufacturers and engine sizes. These differences are currently not directly accounted for in European emissions inventories.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Distance-specific CO2 and NOx emissions (g km-1) for Euro 6 light duty vehicles. Each dot represents a unique manufacturer group-engine size combination, with size proportional to the number of observations included in its calculation. The diamonds represent the weighted mean for each engine size, and the horizontal lines the weighted mean for each vehicle category (Diesel Light Commercial Vehicle, Diesel Passenger Car, Gasoline Passenger Car). Taken from Davison et al. (2021).\n\n\nI also used statistical modelling techniques to examine other effects on vehicle emission concentrations. For example, quantile regression (via the {quantreg} package) was used to examine the skewed relationships between cumulative mileage and fuel-specific emissions in passenger cars. Figure 2, taken from Davison et al. (2022), shows that there are a small proportion of high-mileage gasoline Euro 3 passenger cars which are higher emitting than the average Euro 5/6 diesel cars.\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Plot showing the modelled linear deterioration of passenger cars from 0 to 160,000~km of cumulative mileage (a vehicle’s ``normal life’’ under Euro 6 legislation.

Here are some issues I can identify:\n\nOur key variables are effectively year, race, total and standard error, but race is spread over multiple columns (remember - each column should represent a variable, not multiple columns representing one variable).\nAll of the columns should be numbers, but they have read in as characters.\nAsian people and Pacific Islanders are given twice - as a total of the two and individually.\nThe names of the columns have spaces in them, are wordy and therefore generally difficult to use.\nThe Total column represents the year. The name is therefore a bit misleading.\n\nA note on the emboldened item above; in my experience, data “in the wild” that has been put together in Excel typically has baggage like this as spreadsheets are sadly used for both data storage and presentation. This means that totals and the like are given alongside the data used to calculate them. I don’t feel bad about removing data like this as long as we are left with the tools to recalculate them. In this case, we are! If we want to regroup the Asian/Pacific Islander data it’d be as easy as renaming them both as the same thing using mutate() and if_else(), and then group_by() and summarise() to re-calculate the total. It may even be that we want to combine more racial groups using a fct_lump() function."

For those unfamiliar, this function cleans the names of a data frame to make them easier to use - all lower-case, spaces replaced with underscores, and the like. Normally it’s a good idea to use it as soon as possible, but as I am going to restructure my data I am not going to use it right away. As race will be one of my columns, I’d probably want words like “White” and “Black” to remain capitalised, so if I reported them in a table or use them in a legend label they’d look more presentable.\nNext, we can start restructuring. A good trick with pivot_longer() is that it behaves much the same as functions like select() - if we list a column name preceded with a minus sign (-) it effectively tells the function “everything but this column, please!” I’m not going to specify column names for the names or values here as we’ll quickly get rid of them.\n\nbach_students %>%\n  mutate(across(.cols = where(is.character), \n                .fns = parse_number)) %>%\n  pivot_longer(-Total) %>% \n  head(16)\n\n# A tibble: 16 × 3\n   Total name                                                              value\n   <dbl> <chr>                                                             <dbl>\n 1  1910 \"Total, percent of all persons age 25 and over\"                     2.7\n 2  1910 \"Standard Errors - Total, percent of all persons age 25 and over\"  NA  \n 3  1910 \"White1\"                                                           NA  \n 4  1910 \"Standard Errors - White1\"                                         NA  \n 5  1910 \"Black1\"                                                           NA  \n 6  1910 \"Standard Errors - Black1\"                                         NA  \n 7  1910 \"Hispanic\"                                                         NA  \n 8  1910 \"Standard Errors - Hispanic\"                                       NA  \n 9  1910 \"Total - Asian/Pacific Islander\"                                   NA  \n10  1910 \"Standard Errors - Total - Asian/Pacific Islander\"                 NA  \n11  1910 \"Asian/Pacific Islander - Asian\"                                   NA  \n12  1910 \"Standard Errors - Asian/Pacific Islander - Asian\"                 NA  \n13  1910 \"Asian/Pacific Islander - Pacific Islander\"                        NA  \n14  1910 \"Standard Errors - Asian/Pacific Islander - Pacific Islander\"      NA  \n15  1910 \"American Indian/\\r\\nAlaska Native\"                                NA  \n16  1910 \"Standard Errors - American Indian/\\r\\nAlaska Native\"              NA  \n\n\nNow we can remove that Asian/Pacific Islander total we spoke about earlier.

    "title": "Scraping the Pasta Academy",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Note\n\n\n\nAt time of writing this blog, the Pasta Academy did not have a filter on their website. They have since got their act together and implemented one, making much of this code no longer useful! It is, however, still interesting, and a nice introduction to applying rvest to solve a real (at the time) problem.\n\n\nPurpose\nRecently, my partner and I were looking to book a cooking experience as a Christmas treat, and we settled on the excellently reviewed Pasta Academy in London. We were looking for a beginner class in early 2023, but we were immediately met with an issue — there was no way to filter the booking list!\nWe could have sat and go through the list manually, perhaps noting down each of the beginner classes when we found them. This sounded like a bit of a faff, so I instead thought I’d scrape all of the courses and put them into a table. Some might argue that writing an R script to do this is even more of a faff, but I did it anyway!\nThis blog post shows how I scraped the data from the Pasta Academy website using rvest and then went on to tidy it using the tidyverse. You may find this a nice introduction to web scraping in R, and a nice application of data skills in “real life”.\nWeb Scraping with {rvest}\n\n\nlibrary(rvest)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nWe’ll start by scraping the first page. To start using rvest, we first need to define a session. This simulates a user interacting with a website.\n\npasta_session <-\n  session(\"https://pastaevangelists.com/collections/pasta-academy?page=1\")\n\nWe’ll now need to pull each individual element of interest from the Pasta Academy website. One of the easiest ways of finding the correct HTML at which to aim your rvest functions is by using Chrome’s developer tools (CTRL-SHIFT-I on Windows) or your browser’s equivalent.\n\n\nFigure 1: A screenshot of the use of Chrome’s developer tools.\n\n\nOnce we have identified the correct HTML tags to use, we can use html_elements() to grab those items, and then html_text2() to extract the text from it. For example, the below line grabs each lesson title from the first page of the Pasta Academy website.\n\nhtml_elements(pasta_session, \".product-item-row__meta-title\") |> html_text2()\n\n [1] \"PASTA ACADEMY™ | BEGINNERS CLASS |\\r\"                          \n [2] \"PASTA ACADEMY™ | TASTE OF PUGLIA |\\r\"                          \n [3] \"PASTA ACADEMY™ | MORNING BEGINNERS |\\r\"                        \n [4] \"PASTA ACADEMY™ | BEGINNERS CLASS |\\r\"                          \n [5] \"PASTA ACADEMY™ | TASTE OF VENICE |\\r\"                          \n [6] \"PASTA ACADEMY™ | MORNING BEGINNERS |\\r\"                        \n [7] \"PASTA ACADEMY™ | TASTE OF SARDINIA |\\r\"                        \n [8] \"PASTA ACADEMY™ | TASTE OF ROME |\\r\"                            \n [9] \"PASTA ACADEMY™ | TASTE OF BOLOGNA |\\r\"                         \n[10] \"PASTA ACADEMY™ | LIMITED EDITION SEAFOOD PASTA MASTERCLASS |\\r\"\n[11] \"PASTA ACADEMY™ | LIMITED EDITION SEAFOOD PASTA MASTERCLASS |\\r\"\n[12] \"PASTA ACADEMY™ | MORNING BEGINNERS |\\r\"                        \n[13] \"PASTA ACADEMY™ | LIMITED EDITION SEAFOOD PASTA MASTERCLASS |\\r\"\n[14] \"PASTA ACADEMY™ | BEGINNERS CLASS |\\r\"                          \n[15] \"PASTA ACADEMY™ | MORNING BEGINNERS |\\r\"                        \n[16] \"PASTA ACADEMY™ | BEGINNERS CLASS |\\r\"                          \n[17] \"PASTA ACADEMY™ | TASTE OF SARDINIA |\\r\"                        \n[18] \"PASTA ACADEMY™ | TASTE OF TUSCANY |\\r\"                         \n[19] \"PASTA ACADEMY™ | BEGINNERS CLASS |\\r\"                          \n[20] \"PASTA ACADEMY™ | BEGINNERS CLASS |\\r\"                          \n\n\nAll we need to do is repeat this until we have all of the information we want. In this case, all I need is the course title, the date/time, the price, and whether or not it is sold out. The button text is a useful proxy for that last item, as it reads “SEE INFO” if a course is fully booked and “BOOK NOW” if there are spaces left.\n\nname <- html_elements(pasta_session, \".product-item-row__meta-title\") |> html_text2()\n\ndate <- html_elements(pasta_session, \".product-item-row__meta-title-sub\") |> html_text2()\n\nprice <- html_elements(pasta_session, \"span.price\") |> html_text2()\n\nbutton <- html_elements(pasta_session, \".product-item-row__cta-btn\") |> html_text2()\n\ndplyr::tibble(\n  name = name, \n  date = date,\n  price = price, \n  button = button\n) |>\n  dplyr::glimpse()\n\nRows: 20\nColumns: 4\n$ name   <chr> \"PASTA ACADEMY™ | BEGINNERS CLASS |\\r\", \"PASTA ACADEMY™ | TASTE…\n$ date   <chr> \"\\r Wednesday March 1st, 2023, 18:30\\r\", \"\\r Friday March 3rd, …\n$ price  <chr> \"£65.00\\r\", \"£65.00\\r\", \"£65.00\\r\", \"£65.00\\r\", \"£65.00\\r\", \"£6…\n$ button <chr> \"SEE INFO\", \"SEE INFO\", \"SEE INFO\", \"SEE INFO\", \"SEE INFO\", \"SE…\n\n\nNow all four pieces of information can be scraped from one page, we can use purrr to scrape this information from all of the pages. We’ll write a function which takes one argument, id, which is used to select the specific page of the Pasta Academy website.\n\nscrape_pasta <- function(id){\n  x <- session(str_glue(\"https://pastaevangelists.com/collections/pasta-academy?page={id}\"))\n  \n  tibble(\n    name = html_elements(x, \".product-item-row__meta-title\") |> html_text2(),\n    date = html_elements(x, \".product-item-row__meta-title-sub\") |> html_text2(),\n    price = html_elements(x, \"span.price\") |> html_text2(),\n    fully_booked = html_elements(x, \".product-item-row__cta-btn\") |> html_text2()\n  ) |>\n    mutate(page_id = id)\n}\n\nraw_pasta <- map_dfr(1:19, scrape_pasta)\n\nTidying Data\nWe wouldn’t eat raw pasta, and we won’t want to work with raw_pasta as it currently exists. Lets use the tidyverse to tidy this data up a bit.\nFirst, lets get rid of some of the dodgy formatting — we’ll drop the \\r, vertical bars, question marks, and the PASTA ACADEMY branding from all character columns.\n\npasta <- \n  raw_pasta |>\n  mutate(across(where(is.character), \n                ~ str_remove_all(.x, \"PASTA ACADEMY™|\\r|\\\\||\\\\?\") |> \n                  str_squish()))\npasta\n\n# A tibble: 145 × 5\n   name                                      date          price fully…¹ page_id\n   <chr>                                     <chr>         <chr> <chr>     <int>\n 1 BEGINNERS CLASS                           Wednesday Ma… £65.… SEE IN…       1\n 2 TASTE OF PUGLIA                           Friday March… £65.… SEE IN…       1\n 3 MORNING BEGINNERS                         Saturday Mar… £65.… SEE IN…       1\n 4 BEGINNERS CLASS                           Saturday Mar… £65.… SEE IN…       1\n 5 TASTE OF VENICE                           Saturday Mar… £65.… SEE IN…       1\n 6 MORNING BEGINNERS                         Sunday March… £65.… SEE IN…       1\n 7 TASTE OF SARDINIA                         Sunday March… £65.… SEE IN…       1\n 8 TASTE OF ROME                             Sunday March… £65.… SEE IN…       1\n 9 TASTE OF BOLOGNA                          Monday March… £65.… SEE IN…       1\n10 LIMITED EDITION SEAFOOD PASTA MASTERCLASS Tuesday Marc… £85.… BOOK N…       1\n# … with 135 more rows, and abbreviated variable name ¹​fully_booked\n\n\nAn easier step — lets format the price as numeric data, and fully_booked as logical.

Sadly, this column is not consistently formatted. The two issues are:\n\nSometimes the time has a comma before it, but not always\nSometimes the year is present, but not always\n\nTo deal with this, we’ll take the following steps:\n\nExtract the time & year from the date using regex.\nFill any missing years. This might not be perfect if there are missing years between December and January, but for our purposes we can live with this and can cross-reference with page_id if we need to double check.\nReformat the date by performing string transformations.\nParse the date as a date-time using lubridate.\n\nIn practice, this looks like this:\n\npasta <-\n  pasta |>\n  \n  # extract year/time\n  mutate(\n    time = str_extract(date, \"[0-9][0-9]:[0-9][0-9]\"),\n    year = str_extract(date, \"[0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9]\")\n  ) |>\n  \n  # fill year\n  fill(year, .direction = \"down\") |>\n  \n  # reformat date \n  mutate(date = str_remove_all(date, time) |>\n           str_remove_all(year) |>\n           str_remove(\", \") |>\n           str_squish() |> \n           str_remove(\", am\")) |> \n  separate(date, c(\"day\", \"date\"), sep = \" \", extra = \"merge\") |> \n  unite(date, date, year, time, sep = \" \") |> \n  mutate(date = str_remove(date, \",\")) |> \n  \n  # parse date as date-time\n  mutate(date = lubridate::parse_date_time(date, \n                                           orders = c(\"BdY HM\", \"dBY HM\"))) |>\n  \n  # drop date\n  select(-day)\n\npasta\n\n# A tibble: 145 × 5\n   name                                date                price fully…¹ page_id\n   <chr>                               <dttm>              <dbl> <lgl>     <int>\n 1 beginners class                     2023-03-01 18:30:00    65 TRUE          1\n 2 taste of puglia                     2023-03-03 18:30:00    65 TRUE          1\n 3 morning beginners                   2023-03-04 10:00:00    65 TRUE          1\n 4 beginners class                     2023-03-04 13:00:00    65 TRUE          1\n 5 taste of venice                     2023-03-04 18:30:00    65 TRUE          1\n 6 morning beginners                   2023-03-05 10:00:00    65 TRUE          1\n 7 taste of sardinia                   2023-03-05 13:00:00    65 TRUE          1\n 8 taste of rome                       2023-03-05 18:30:00    65 TRUE          1\n 9 taste of bologna                    2023-03-06 18:30:00    65 TRUE          1\n10 limited edition seafood pasta mast… 2023-03-07 18:30:00    85 FALSE         1\n# … with 135 more rows, and abbreviated variable name ¹​fully_booked\n\n\nUsing the data\nNow that the data is in a tidy format, lets find out when the available beginner courses are being held.

    "text": "Lump\nTo overcome the disadvantage above (and return to a bar chart) we could use forcats to “lump” some of the smaller categories together into one “Other” category.\nAdvantage: Each of the legend items are now readable and distinct - no more tiny little bars that can’t be discerned right at the bottom. Absolute values are shown.\nDisadvantage: Not all of the sectors have a legend item now. Some readers may skip the caption or body text and not acknowledge what “Other” is composed of. We’ve also lost the specific values for the individual “Other” sectors (not that they could really be read before!)\nHow: We can use a function from the forcats::fct_lump() family to “lump” together the smaller sectors. In this case we use forcats::fct_lump_lowfreq(), which makes sure the “Other” category is always the smallest one. Optionally, we can extract the sectors that make up “Other” and list them in the plot caption (or the body of our report).\n\ncopper2 <-\n  mutate(copper,\n         sector_lumped = forcats::fct_lump_lowfreq(Sectors, w = value, other_level = \"Other*\"))\n\nother_cats <-\n  filter(copper2, sector_lumped == \"Other*\") |>\n  distinct(Sectors) |>\n  pull() |>\n  paste(collapse = \", \")\n\nggplot(copper2, aes(x = year, y = value)) +\n  geom_col(aes(fill = sector_lumped)) +\n  coord_cartesian(expand = FALSE) +\n  theme(legend.position = \"top\") +\n  labs(x = NULL, y = \"Annual UK Copper Emissions (kt)\",\n       fill = NULL,\n       caption = stringr::str_wrap(paste0(\"*\", other_cats))) +\n  scale_fill_brewer(palette = \"Dark2\") +\n  theme(legend.position = \"top\")\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Lumping the small categories makes the plot easier to read, but we’ve lost the individual values from the ‘Other’ sectors."

    "text": "Scale Transform\nIf we want a bar chart and to retain all the individual sectors, we could choose to use a scale transform. A common scale transform is the log-transform, but there are plenty out there. For example, we could use a square-root axis.\nAdvantage: Each of the individual sectors are now visually distinct from one another.\nDisadvantage: Scale transformed axes are harder to read. Many people aren’t familiar with the concept at all - though some would question if that always really matters.\nHow: ggplot2 makes it easy to transform scales. All of the continuous scales_*_*() functions have the “trans” argument which can transform the axes however we like. There are even short-cuts for the x and y axes, like scale_y_sqrt() and scale_y_log10().\n\nggplot(copper, aes(x = year, y = value)) +\n  geom_col(aes(fill = Sectors)) +\n  coord_cartesian(expand = FALSE) +\n  labs(x = NULL, y = \"Annual UK Copper Emissions (kt)\", fill = NULL) +\n  scale_fill_brewer(palette = \"Dark2\") +\n  scale_y_sqrt(breaks = c(0, 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2)) +\n  theme(legend.position = \"top\")\n\n\n\nFigure 4: The y-axis is now on a transformed scale; all the categories stand out, but it isn’t necessarily easy to read."

We could “zoom in” on specific parts of our chart, making it much easier to view those smaller bars in our stacked barchart.\nAdvantage: “Best of both worlds” - we get our original plot as well as a version from which readers can see the smaller categories.\nDisadvantage: The plot is now nearly twice as big. We must also now make sure that readers are clear what each panel represents to avoid confusion.\nHow: The ggforce::facet_zoom() function is a special faceting function which is designed to do exactly what we’re after here.\n\nggplot(copper, aes(x = year, y = value)) +\n  geom_col(aes(fill = Sectors)) +\n  labs(x = NULL, y = \"Annual UK Copper Emissions (kt)\", fill = NULL) +\n  theme(legend.position = \"top\") +\n  scale_fill_brewer(palette = \"Dark2\") +\n  ggforce::facet_zoom(y = value <= 0.02,\n                      zoom.size = .5,\n                      show.area = T)\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Zooming in on a specific part of the plot lets us have the best of both worlds!"

Tooltips can also reveal the precise value of each sector when the reader hovers over the corresponding bar.\nDisadvantage: Restricted to HTML; cannot be inserted into an academic article or powerpoint presentation. Needs an amount of explanation so readers are aware that they can interact with the figure.\nHow: There are plenty of different ways to create interactive plots in R, including plotly, dygraphs and ggiraph.

In a table, each value takes up the exact same amount of space, so there’s no such thing as a sector too small to really make out.\nAdvantage: Every single value can be read. With an interactive table the data is even searchable.\nDisadvantage: It’s not a chart any more. It is also much harder to tell a story with a table like this (e.g., the trend is much harder to identify with a list of numbers).\nHow: There are a lot of table packages in R, such as gt, reactable and DT. Here we use DT to create an interactive, searchable table.\n\ncopper |>\n  mutate(Sectors = factor(Sectors)) |>\n  DT::datatable(rownames = FALSE, filter = \"top\") |>\n  DT::formatSignif(columns = 3, digits = 5)\n\n\nFigure 7: This isn’t a plot any more, but it does the job!"
