      The UK Hydrocarbons Network comprises automatic and non-automatic
      systems to measure benzene and other VOCs. This quarto report is
      published annually to summarise measurements from this network and
      track compliance to the European Directive 2008/50/EC (AQD).

      Typically, during the hottest parts of summer, the UK will experience
      episodes of elevated ozone which are associated with deleterious health
      effects. This quarto report summarises a particularly protracted ozone
      episode in 2023, and includes applications of then-new functionality
      of `{gt}` and `{bslib}`.

      Perhaps unsurprisingly, measured concentrations of airborne particulates
      typically peak on Bonfire Night in the UK. This quarto report examines
      bonfire night on 2023 in particular, and provides commentary on the
      utility of the "Daily Air Quality Index" (DAQI) as a framework for
      short-lived events like a bonfire event.
