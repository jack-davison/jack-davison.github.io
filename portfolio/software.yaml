  description: |
      `{openair}` is a long standing R package for atmospheric composition data
      analysis. I was added as an author over a decade into its existence and
      have made efforts to modernise some of the code, fix back-logs of issues,
      and add features with a focus on making it easier to program
      with `{openair}`.

  description: |
      `{openairmaps}` combines `{openair}` analysis approaches with the `{leaflet}`
      interactive mapping library. The headline feature is the ability to put
      bivariate polar plots on interactive maps, which allows for pollutant
      source triangulation. Other features include visualising UK monitoring
      networks and HYSPLIT trajectory paths.

- title: "{lipsum}"

      `{lipsum}` is a very simple package for calling a variety of Web APIs
      from the awesome-lipsum list. It was mainly an exercise in playing with
      the `{curl}` package, but could be useful for users to obtain a variety
      of fun placeholder texts.
