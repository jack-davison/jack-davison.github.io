- title: "Tabulating DuBois: Recreating Historical Data Visualisations with `{gt}`"
  description: |
      This submission to the Posit (then RStudio) Table Contest 2022 takes the form
      of eight tables which attempt to reflect the style and/or spirit of some
      of W.E.B. DuBois 20th century visualisations. It effectively revisits
      The #DuBois Challenge but using data tables as the medium instead of
      graphs. Awarded "Runner Up".

- title: "Using `{gt}`, `{gtExtras}` and `{openair}` to present air quality monitoring data"
  description: |
      A submission to the Posit (then RStudio) Table Contest 2021; a tutorial
      for presenting air quality monitoring data in summary tables using `{gt}`.
      The most interesting aspect of this was combining `{openair}` with `{gt}`
      to embed bivariate polar plots in the `{gt}` table itself. Awarded
      "Honourable Mention".

      As part of an exercise to learn `{bslib}` and `{shiny}` more widely,
      I spent an afternoon coding a dashboard to visualise the salary
      distribution of UK footballers.

- title: "Shiny App: Track the ISS"
  description: |
      The second app I authored to help learn `{bslib}` and `{shiny}`, but also
      to get more comfortable talking to APIs with R. Using this app users can
      track the current position of the International Space Station (ISS).
