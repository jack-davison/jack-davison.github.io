  description: |
      This submission to the Posit (then RStudio) Table Contest 2022 takes the form
      of eight tables which attempt to reflect the style and/or spirit of some
      of W.E.B. DuBois 20th century visualisations. It effectively revisits
      The #DuBois Challenge but using data tables as the medium instead of
      graphs. Awarded "Runner Up".

- title: "Using `{gt}`, `{gtExtras}` and `{openair}` to present air quality monitoring data"
  description: |
      A submission to the Posit (then RStudio) Table Contest 2021; a tutorial
      for presenting air quality monitoring data in summary tables using `{gt}`.
      The most interesting aspect of this was combining `{openair}` with `{gt}`
      to embed bivariate polar plots in the `{gt}` table itself. Awarded
      "Honourable Mention".
