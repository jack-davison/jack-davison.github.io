I am passionate about data visualisation and communication in all of its forms. This page details some of the projects I've been part of.

### TidyTuesday

\#TidyTuesday is a weekly data challenge which tests the R community to tidy and visualise an unseen dataset, which could be related to anything from astronauts to zoo animals! @fig-tt is a collage of a few of my favourite contributions, with my full repo found at <https://github.com/jack-davison/TidyTuesday>.

### DuBois Challenge

The DuBois Challenge is a challenge to recreate historic, hand drawn data visualisations using modern tools. The visualisations are specifically the work of data-viz pioneer W.E.B. DuBois, known for his subversive, geometric, ahead-of-his-time designs.

I took part in the DuBois Challenge as part of \#TidyTuesday (above), but my deepest examination of DuBois' work was in my submission for the Posit Table Contest 2022, [Tabulating DuBois](https://jack-davison.quarto.pub/tabulating-dubois/), wherein I attempted to translate the work of DuBois to a more tabular medium with `{gt}`.
