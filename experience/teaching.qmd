I am a [Posit (formerly RStudio) Certified Tidyverse Instructor](https://education.rstudio.com/trainers/) with over 5 years experience teaching reproducible data analysis in R to a variety of audiences. Typically these courses centre around the analysis of environmental data, specifically long term monitoring data.

I have delivered training to learners from organisations such as:

* UK Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Afairs (Defra)

* UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA)

* UK Environment Agency (EA)

* The Clean Air Society of Australia and New Zealand (CASANZ)

* Port Talbot Local Authority

* UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology (UKCEH)

* The Wolfson Atmospheric Chemistry Laboratories (WACL)

### Approach

I am a proponent of live coding in teaching, meaning that learners can see RStudio used in an authentic way. Authentic examples showing real-world applications of R are important to ensure that the content is relevant to learner's interests. Teaching is supported by extensive, reproducible learning materials written in `{quarto}` (formerly `{rmarkdown}`). Where possible on longer courses, case studies are written up using data provided by learners to get them started with their own data analysis projects.

@fig-casestudy shows some example course materials produced for a recent course on using R for air quality modelling. An advanced lesson, it outlines a method to use `{readr}` and `{purrr}` to rapidly pull large amounts of kilometre grid-square modelled air quality data from the "UK AIR" website and then plot it using `{ggplot2}`. All of the content is reproducible, allowing learners to explore it further at a later date.
