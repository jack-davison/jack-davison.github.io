`{shiny}` is a platform for building web applications in R (and, more recently, Python). I've produced `{shiny}` applications for clients, for internal dashboards/tools, and for personal projects. One of the key benefits of `{shiny}`, in my opinion, is it allows you to rapidly put together a data dashboard or application that looks good, *without* having to know loads of HTML or CSS. This makes it perfect for development at pace, or creating minimum viable products to show to clients.

Naturally, a lot of these shiny apps can't be more widely shared, but @fig-shiny shows some screenshots of public applications I've made. These specific apps were written very quickly as an exercise to learn `{shiny}` and `{bslib}`, but I'm broadly happy with how they turned out!
