As well as authoring many private R packages to streamline data analysis pipelines for myself and colleagues, I have also developed publicly available packages, many of which focused on air quality data analysis.

During my [PhD](research.qmd) I dabbled in package authorship to collect together personal, miscellaneous functions useful for my work. This experience led to creating several packages used throughout the group for reading awkward instrument data, scraping data from online databases, and perfoming statistical modelling of road transport emissions.

When I started working in consultancy and R development full-time I became involved in open-source package authorship by becoming an author for the `{openair}` project let by Professor David Carslaw. The `{openair}` toolkit is a collection of R packages for atmospheric data analysis, including:

::: {.panel-tabset}

## `{openair}`

The original toolbox of plotting, analysis, and data access functions.

```{r}
#| label: fig-openair
#| fig-cap: A polar plot, one of the most attractive features of `{openair}`.
openair::polarPlot(openair::mydata, "nox")
```

## `{worldmet}`

A tool for obtaining world meteorological data from the NOAA ISD database.

```{r}
#| label: fig-worldmet
#| fig-cap: A map of NOAA ISD meteorological stations obtained using `{worldmet}`.
worldmet::getMeta(returnMap = TRUE)
```

## `{openairmaps}`

A package which combines `{openair}` with `{leaflet}` to create interactive air quality maps. I am the lead developer on this specific package.

```{r}
#| label: fig-openairmaps
#| fig-cap: A map of `openair::polarPlot()`s, produced using `{openairmaps}`.
openairmaps::polarMap(openairmaps::polar_data,
                      "nox",
                      latitude = "lat",
                      longitude = "lon")
```
