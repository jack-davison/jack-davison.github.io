As well as authoring many private R packages to streamline data analysis pipelines for myself and colleagues, I have also developed publicly available packages, many of which focused on air quality data analysis.

During my [PhD](research.qmd) I dabbled in package authorship to collect together personal, miscellaneous functions useful for my work. This experience led to creating several packages used throughout the group for reading awkward instrument data, scraping data from online databases, and perfoming statistical modelling of road transport emissions.

When I started working in consultancy and R development full-time I became involved in open-source package authorship by becoming an author for the `{openair}` project let by Professor David Carslaw. The `{openair}` tool kit is a collection of R packages for atmospheric data analysis.

Examples of R packages I have helped develop can be found in my [portfolio](../portfolio.qmd).
