This makes it perfect for development at pace, or creating minimum viable products to show to clients.\nNaturally, a lot of these shiny apps can’t be more widely shared, but Figure 1 shows some screenshots of public applications I’ve made.

    "text": "My PhD thesis (Davison 2022) focused on the calculation of representative emission factors from vehicle emission remote sensing data. An emission factor is a value used to estimate a total emission from a sector (e.g., transport) from a more measurable activity (e.g., total kilometres driven).\n\\(Emission~Estimate~\\left(g\\right) = \\textbf{Emission~Factor}~\\left(g~km^{-1}\\right) \\times Measured~Activity~\\left(km\\right)\\)\nTypically these emission factors are based on data from a very limited range of vehicles, most commonly from lab tests but also from instrumented vehicles (Portable Emissions Monitoring Systems, PEMS). While these give good journey coverage, capturing everything from idling to bombing down the motorway, they give poor fleet coverage, only measuring a handful of “representative” vehicles.\nVehicle emission remote sensing is a technique for measuring a lot of vehicles. Think of it as a bit like a speed camera with a spectrometer attached, that being an instrument capable of measuring pollutant concentrations in the atmosphere. While the use of remote sensing rapidly populates a database of hundreds of thousands of tailpipe concentration measurements, only measuring a dispersing plume (rather than the sum total of all tailpipe emissions) means some robust statistical modelling is required to calculate representative emission factors.\nOne of the key outcomes from my research was the clear significance of the difference in emissions between vehicle manufacturers. Figure 1, taken from Davison et al. (2021), illustrates the distribution of different distance-specific emissions for different vehicle manufacturers and engine sizes. These differences are currently not directly accounted for in European emissions inventories.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Distance-specific CO2 and NOx emissions (g km-1) for Euro 6 light duty vehicles. Each dot represents a unique manufacturer group-engine size combination, with size proportional to the number of observations included in its calculation. The diamonds represent the weighted mean for each engine size, and the horizontal lines the weighted mean for each vehicle category (Diesel Light Commercial Vehicle, Diesel Passenger Car, Gasoline Passenger Car). Taken from Davison et al. (2021).\n\n\nI also used statistical modelling techniques to examine other effects on vehicle emission concentrations. For example, quantile regression (via the quantreg package) was used to examine the skewed relationships between cumulative mileage and fuel-specific emissions in passenger cars. Figure 2, taken from Davison et al. (2022), shows that there are a small proportion of high-mileage gasoline Euro 3 passenger cars which are higher emitting than the average Euro 5/6 diesel cars.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Plot showing the modelled linear deterioration of passenger cars from 0 to 160,000~km of cumulative mileage (a vehicle’s ``normal life’’ under Euro 6 legislation.

Typically these courses centre around the analysis of environmental data, specifically long term monitoring data.\nI have delivered training to learners from organisations such as:\n\nUK Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Afairs (Defra)\nUK Health Security Agency (UKHSA)\nUK Environment Agency (EA)\nThe Clean Air Society of Australia and New Zealand (CASANZ)\nPort Talbot Local Authority\nUK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology (UKCEH)\nThe Wolfson Atmospheric Chemistry Laboratories (WACL)\n\nApproach\nI am a proponent of live coding in teaching, meaning that learners can see RStudio used in an authentic way. Authentic examples showing real-world applications of R are important to ensure that the content is relevant to learner’s interests. Teaching is supported by extensive, reproducible learning materials written in quarto (formerly rmarkdown). Where possible on longer courses, case studies are written up using data provided by learners to get them started with their own data analysis projects.\nFigure 1 shows some example course materials produced for a recent course on using R for air quality modelling. An advanced lesson, it outlines a method to use readr and purrr to rapidly pull large amounts of kilometre grid-square modelled air quality data from the “UK AIR” website and then plot it using ggplot2. All of the content is reproducible, allowing learners to explore it further at a later date.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: An example of reproducible course materials, commonly produced when teaching R."
