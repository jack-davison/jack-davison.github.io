My main research interests lie in the remote measurements and modelling of road transport exhaust emissions.\r\nIâ€™ve been using and refining my R skills over the past three years, with particular attention to the Tidyverse suite of R packages.\r\nI have contributed to the #TidyTuesday Project since Summer 2020. My submissions can be found on my GitHub or Twitter.\r\nIn 2021, I became an RStudio Certified Tidyverse Instructor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
